# Facial Recognition for Student Attendance
## Abstract:
Facial recognition technology offers a promising solution for automating student attendance management in educational institutions, streamlining the process, enhancing efficiency, and ensuring data integrity. This project introduces a comprehensive facial recognition system designed to address these objectives.

The system consists of two main entities: administrators and teachers. Administrators access a user-friendly web portal that serves as the central hub for managing the database and training the facial recognition model. Teachers utilize a dedicated application, empowering them to mark attendance for their respective subjects conveniently.

Leveraging advanced computer vision algorithms, including Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks, FaceNet, and Support Vector Machines, the system captures and securely stores facial images of students in a robust database. The facial recognition model is trained extensively to enable real-time identification and verification of student identities using the captured images.

Implementing the facial recognition system yields multiple benefits. It significantly reduces the administrative workload associated with manual attendance tracking, freeing up valuable time for teachers. Moreover, the system drastically enhances efficiency, as attendance can be marked swiftly and accurately. By eliminating the reliance on traditional methods, such as roll calls or sign-in sheets, human errors are minimized, resulting in improved data accuracy.

To ensure data integrity and security, the system incorporates robust measures. Attendance records are stored securely, preventing unauthorized access or tampering. Additionally, privacy-preserving techniques are implemented to address concerns regarding the storage and processing of students' data.
